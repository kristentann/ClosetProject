# My Personal Project: Closet Organiser

## Keeps track of the clothes a user has in their closet 

This project can be used by: 
- anyone who wants to organise their closet: when they buy new clothes or want to sell/ give away old clothes
- users that want to keep track of the clothes they already have inside their closet
- users that want to choose their outfit even if they are away from home

With this project, users can track an unlimited amount of
clothing in their closet with the description of items they input manually. The user must
type in a **specific item** to make this app accurate, e.g. Sculpt Knit
V-neck Tank Top from Aritzia. The fields of each *clothing* include
**tops, bottoms, jackets, shoes, dresses/suits, accessories.**

I am passionate in this project as I have always been interested in fashion and as I embarked in the Business and 
Computer Science programme
and learned more about the
technological industry, I am convinced that there exists an untapped synergy
between the fashion and technological industries. Therefore, my aim is to see the intersectionality 
between these two domains. 
In addition, I was also inspired by a movie that I saw when I was younger, called Clueless. In this movie
they used an app that had a very similar function to this application. Furthermore, there have been 
occasions when I found myself desiring
to pick out an outfit for the next day or an event,
yet I lacked the recollection of the contents of my wardrobe.
It was during these moments that I yearned for a means to efficiently
track and manage my clothing collection.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add clothes to my closet 
- As a user, I want to be able to remove clothes from my closet 
- As a user, I want to be able to sort the clothes in my closet in each category.
- As a user, I want to check if I have a similar clothing piece in my closet
- As a user, I want to know the number of clothes I have in each category.
- As a user, I want to see the tops I have of a certain colour.
- As a user, I want to be able to save all the clothing items that I added to my closet. 
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to have the option to load all the clothing items I have in my closet before 
- opening my closet. 

## Phase 4: Task 3:
- If I had more time to work on this project, I would include more functionality into the GUI
- Due to my limited amount of time, I had to disregard one of my user stories that was functional in my console
- I wish for the future, I will be able to utilise more JSwing components to make a more elaborate design for my GUI as
- well as maximise the potential of my project, in this project I had to use a somewhat similar format for each
- Also, I also wish for the future that I will be able to make a button to reset all the user input, for example in the
- addClothing panel, each textField has to be manually deleted by the user in order to add a new item to their closet.
