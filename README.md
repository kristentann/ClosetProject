# My Personal Project: Closet Organiser

## Keeps track of the clothes a user has in their closet 

This project can be used by: 
- anyone who wants to organise their closet: when they buy new clothes or want to sell/ give away old clothes
- users that want to keep track of the clothes they already have inside their closet
- users that want to choose their outfit even if they are away from home

With this project, users can track an unlimited amount of
clothing in their closet with the description of items they input manually. The user must
type in a **specific item** to make this app accurate, e.g. Sculpt Knit
V-neck Tank Top from Aritzia. The fields of each *clothing* include
**tops, bottoms, jackets, shorts, shoes, dresses/suits, accessories.**

I am passionate in this project as I have always been interested in fashion and as I embarked in the Business and 
Computer Science programme
and learned more about the
technological industry, I am convinced that there exists an untapped synergy
between the fashion and technological industries. Therefore, my aim is to see the intersectionality 
between these two domains. 
In addition, I was also inspired by a movie that I saw when I was younger, called Clueless. In this movie
they used an app that had a very similar function to this application. Furthermore, there have been 
occasions when I found myself desiring
to pick out an outfit for the next day or an event,
yet I lacked the recollection of the contents of my wardrobe.
It was during these moments that I yearned for a means to efficiently
track and manage my clothing collection.
